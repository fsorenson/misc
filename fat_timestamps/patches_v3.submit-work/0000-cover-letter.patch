Subject: [PATCH V3 0/4] fat: timestamp updates

vfat/msdos timestamps are stored on-disk with several different
granularities, some of them lower resolution than timespec_trunc()
can provide.  In addition, they are only truncated as they are
written to disk, so the timestamps in-memory for new or modified
files/directories may be different from the same timestamps after
a remount, as the now-truncated times are re-read from the on-disk
format.

These patches allow finer granularity for the timestamps where
possible and add fat-specific ->update_time inode operation and
fat_truncate_time functions to truncate each timestamp correctly,
giving consistent times across remounts.


Frank Sorenson (4):
  fat: set the s_time_gran for msdos or vfat mounts
  fat: create function to calculate timezone offset
  fat: add functions to update and truncate the timestamps appropriately
  fat: change timestamp updates to fat_update_time or fat_truncate_time
